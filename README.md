Alonira is just me delving into OSDev again again. It aims to enable the use of a subset of the [Genstone](https://github.com/Th3T3chn0G1t/Genstone) API in the kernel and make use of Genstone error backpropogation utilities etc.

Secondarily (once it comes to it) - in lieu of a traditional program loader where usermode programs are native executables, I plan to make use of [Cíonom](https://github.com/Th3T3chn0G1t/Cionom) bytecode as the sole method of usermode code execution.

These two arguably questionable design decisions are because:
- I am lazy
- I think it's funny
- A very small part of me thinks it's cool
